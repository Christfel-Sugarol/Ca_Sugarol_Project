				<p>This is Me, Christfel Y. Sugarol. As you can see I am a energetic boy at the age of 15. My name is something some people mistake as a girl's, but how did I get it? My parents said they formed my name from the "Christ" of my brother named "Christian" and the "fel" came from my parents' "Fe" and "Elmer". And as from what you can just see from what I've said there's 4 of us in our family: me, my older brother, and my father and mother. One trivia about me? I guess it's that I'm a very lazy person and because of that I'm learning programming to automate the tasks I want to do and many more. Which is ironic considering programming takes a lot of time to learn. </p>

					<div>
						<p>Teenage pregnancy is one of the world problems. Especially for poorer countries like Philippines, the problem is larger. Because of that you can more or less encounter some of your acquaintances to experience teenage pregnancy. In my life I have seen some of my acquaintances becoming a parent while they are a teenager. There's also some of them with my relatives and I see that they're not so well-off in life. Which is why I'm wary about teenage pregnancy and chose this as my topic for this vlog.</p>

				<div id="adv-2">

					<div>
						<p>What is my hope for this issue? While other well-off countries have small amount of teenage parents. The rest of the countries have lots of them. Teenage pregnancy is related to the country's state and there's nothing we can do about that unless the countries themselves change. But at least I hope that teenage parents are treated better in society. Pushing them around because of a mistake would make their states worse that before. I hope that everyone will start caring more about these children rather than hating and avoiding them</p>
